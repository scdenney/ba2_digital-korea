## *Optional: Supplementary R Programming*

For students interested in deeper R programming skills:

**Swirl R Programming (Bonus modules):**
- Lesson 5: Missing Values
- Lesson 8: Logic
- Lesson 9: Functions

**Swirl Exploratory Data Analysis (Bonus):**
- Lesson 13: Dimension Reduction

**DataCamp (Bonus):**
- Data Manipulation & Visualization course - Data wrangling including things like filter, mutate, arrange, summarize
- Intermediate R - Additional programming, good for building a better foundation
- Text Mining with Bag-of-Words in R - Basics of text mining using the BoW approach

---

# Time Expectations

**Required R Programming:** Approximately 11-12 hours across the semester (~1 hour per week average)
- Swirl tutorials: ~3-4 hours total
- DataCamp modules: ~8 hours total (not including optional lessons)

**Orange Data Mining Tutorials:** Approximately 8-10 hours across the semester

**Recommended Readings:** ~2 hours per week

**Hands-on Practice:** ~2 hours per assignment

## Assignments

In addition to attending weekly sessions, you are required to complete **weekly assignments ("deliverables")**. These tasks reinforce the skills introduced in tutorials and class exercises. Assignments can be found in the folder marked with the same name ([Assignments](https://github.com/scdenney/ba3_text_as_data/tree/main/assignments)).

### Format
- Each deliverable consists of:
  1. One or more screenshots of your Orange workflow/output
  2. A short written reflection (≈1–2 paragraphs)
  3. Your `.ows` workflow file (where applicable)

### Submission
- Commit your deliverables to your GitHub repository in the appropriate weekly folder (e.g., `week01/`, `week02/`, etc.)
- **Deadline:** 17:00 on the Monday following class unless otherwise specified.
- **Grading:**
  - `2` = fully complete and accurate
  - `1` = attempted but not fully complete/accurate
  - `0` = incomplete, late, or not attempted
- **Note:** You do *not* need to upload assignments to Brightspace. The instructor will review your GitHub repo and record grades.

### Examples
- *Week 1:* Reflection on DH and thesis research
- *Week 2:* Set up your GitHub repo + README
- *Week 3:* Screenshot and reflection on text preprocessing (raw vs. cleaned text)
- Later weeks: continue the same format — apply tutorials, document results, and reflect on significance

👉 **Weekly deliverables, together with attendance, make up 30% of your DH strand grade** (see Assessment section).

## Optional: R Programming Extensions

Students interested in developing foundational R programming skills alongside the DH strand are encouraged to explore the **R Programming Extensions**. These optional activities complement our work with Orange Data Mining and offer pathways to begin coding and analyzing text directly in R.

We will make use of two platforms:
- **Swirl** — interactive, in-R tutorials for learning R at your own pace
  👉 [https://swirlstats.com/students.html](https://swirlstats.com/students.html)
- **DataCamp** — an online learning platform with a dedicated class account

All enrolled students have access to the shared **DataCamp classroom**. The primary course to complete there is:
👉 [Introduction to Text Analysis in R](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-text-analysis-in-r)

Additional short modules may be assigned later, depending on time and fit.

**Assessment policy for the optional R Programming track:**
- **Extra credit** will be awarded upon satisfactory completion of the designated lessons or modules (up to .5 points added to the final DH strand grade).
- Students who opt in but do not complete required lessons may receive a **minor penalty** to their DH strand grade.
  Opt in only if you plan to finish.

## GitHub Repository Requirement

See the ["how-to" guide](repo_how-to.md) (located in the syllabus folder) on how to get started with GitHub and repo management.

You are required to maintain a **private GitHub repository** for this course:

1. Create a new private repo named: `DH-TopicalReading-<Surname>`.
2. Add the instructor (**username: scdenney**) as a collaborator.
3. Keep the repo private, unless you explicitly choose to share it.
4. Organize the repo with the following structure:

📂 Student Repository Structure
<pre>
DH-TopicalReading-<Surname>/
  ├── assignments/    # where you commit your assignments
│   ├── week01/
│   │   ├── week01-deliverable.md
│   │   └── screenshots/
│   ├── week02/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── week12/
│   └── final-project/
└── README.md          # use the README to introduce yourself and what your repo will do for you
</pre>

5. Each week's deliverable (markdown file + screenshots) must be committed to the correct subfolder.
6. At the start of the course, submit the **URL of your repo** to the instructor at [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iVdwLTfmVkMn2cQGXPxCC4YIxADawSKAWltZIxD5WMs/edit?usp=sharing) (click to open).

This organization mirrors best practices for **research data management** and is part of the course's learning objectives.
