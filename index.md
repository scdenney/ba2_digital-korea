# Digital Korea: Computational Text Analysis

**Course:** BA2 Korean Studies, Leiden University
**Instructor:** Dr. Steven Denney
**Time:** Mondays, 15:15-17:00
**Location:** Huizinga 0.09 (DH Lab) & Arsenaal B0.05
**Duration:** 12 sessions (February 02 - May 18)

---

## Course Overview

This course introduces computational text analysis as a research method in Korean studies. You will learn to treat text as data, transforming written sources into formats that can be analyzed computationally.

Using **Orange Data Mining**, a visual platform that makes computational methods accessible without advanced programming, you will work through the complete text analysis pipeline:

- **Preprocessing** - Preparing text for analysis
- **Descriptive analysis** - Finding patterns in word usage
- **Clustering** - Discovering natural groupings in documents
- **Classification** - Categorizing texts using rules and machine learning
- **Topic modeling** - Uncovering hidden themes across collections

You will also develop foundational **R programming** skills through guided tutorials. No prior programming experience is required.

The course culminates in a **Research Methods Project** applying text analysis to Korean-language materials.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Apply text preprocessing, descriptive analysis, clustering, classification, and topic modeling
2. Practice data management and transparency best practices
3. Establish a foundation in the R programming language
4. Reflect on the strengths and limitations of computational methods in research
