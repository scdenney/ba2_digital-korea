## Course Description
This course introduces computational text analysis as a research method in Korean studies and for students in the humanities and social sciences generally. Students learn to treat text as data, transforming written sources into formats that can be analyzed computationally. The course covers pre-processing, descriptive analysis, clustering, classification, and topic modeling using Orange Data Mining, a visual platform that makes computational methods accessible without advanced programming skills. Students also develop foundational R programming through tutorial exercises. No prior programming experience is required. The course culminates in a Research Methods Project applying text analysis to Korean-language materials, which is subsequently applied to a research paper.
